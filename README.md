# 🏥 Hospital Management Dashboard Project

A **comprehensive end-to-end data analysis project** where I designed and developed an interactive Hospital Management Dashboard using **Power BI**, **MySQL**, **Python**, **Excel**, and **Figma**. This project covers everything from data modeling to visual storytelling, enabling smart healthcare insights using real-world simulated data.

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- 📌 **Full-stack data integration**: From raw Excel files to a structured MySQL database.
- ⚙️ **Dynamic dashboards**: Interactive visuals for hospital management, doctors, patients, staff, and finance.
- 🧠 **Power BI mastery**: DAX measures, calculated columns, Power Query, slicers, and drill-through pages.
- 💡 **Real-world simulation**: Reflects how hospitals use data for operations and decision-making.
